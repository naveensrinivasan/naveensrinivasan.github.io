This is will be not be good for Performance.
Using these methods we could either log Anonymous objects or Classes that have the EventData Attribute applied to it. The caveat is that these objects public properties alone will be serialized. These properties have to be of native types like string,int,datetime, guid , IEnumerable.</description></item><item><title>Look ma I figured out why my ETW EventSource isn’t tracing</title><link>/?p=1414/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2015 13:47:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>/?p=1414/</guid><description>The EventSource class in the framework 4.5 helps in writing custom ETW tracing.
When using EventSource class built within the framework, if the order of the methods don’t match ordinal number position in the class it would fail generating ETW traces. The EventSource has dependency on the order of the methods in the class.
This code would produce a valid ETW traces

This one would fail producing any ETW Traces.</description></item><item><title>Identify and Patch .NET Code using Windbg</title><link>/?p=19/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2010 13:30:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>/?p=19/</guid><description>The last week was really an interesting one with debugging production code. I was debugging a Winforms application which was using .NET framework 3.5 version. The real problem was with the latest release of the code, there was bug which caused certain elements on the UI not to be displayed. This is was High priority bug and very important to the business.
The code that was causing this bug was an integer variable inside a class.</description></item></channel></rss>
