&lt;p>tldr: If you want to avoid including OSV/CVE in your &lt;code>go.mod/go.sum&lt;/code> you can utilize this &lt;a href="https://github.com/naveensrinivasan/stunning-tribble">https://github.com/naveensrinivasan/stunning-tribble&lt;/a> tool do that. Here is an example of how this is being used in scorecard &lt;a href="https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/9df865c4f83cfb36bae487125e5ccbc6aef448c6/Makefile#L64-L72">https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/9df865c4f83cfb36bae487125e5ccbc6aef448c6/Makefile#L64-L72&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I contribute to a project that is primarily focused on supply chain security &lt;a href="https://github.com/ossf/scorecard">https://github.com/ossf/scorecard&lt;/a> which is part of Open Source Security Foundation, which is also part of Linux Foundation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We happened to realize that between version 1.2.0 and 2.0.0 we have included a library that happens to have OSV(&lt;a href="https://osv.dev">https://osv.dev&lt;/a>) &lt;a href="https://deps.dev/go/github.com%2Fossf%2Fscorecard/v1.2.0/comparev2=v2.0.0%2Bincompatible">https://deps.dev/go/github.com%2Fossf%2Fscorecard/v1.2.0/comparev2=v2.0.0%2Bincompatible&lt;/a>. This was accidental, and we wanted to check how to avoid this in the future.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
