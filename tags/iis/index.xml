      <description>Recently I had to troubleshoot messages that were being sent from an web application hosted on IIS to an external authentication provider. The logs from the application wasn&amp;#8217;t something closer to the metal and wasn&amp;#8217;t really providing all the details. I really wanted something like fiddler for the webserver. I could have a ran network traces to troubleshoot the issue but the problem was it wasn&amp;#8217;t happening consistently. It was sporadic.</description>
