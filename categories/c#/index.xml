I chose Witty because it is the only OSS .NET twitter client I know of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the reasons for customizing is primarily using C# as compiler service to extend it for my needs dynamically. For example I follow this twitter list &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/shanselman/programmers">http://twitter.com/shanselman/programmers&lt;/a> , it’s a cool list that Scott maintains, thanks to him. But there is one person in this list who keeps tweeting about weight loss, which I am least interested and I didn’t have control over it but to ignore, until now. And it is always fun to write  software for your daily needs, which for me saves time.  Thanks to Mono for C# as compiler service. FYI I have shown a simple usage of Mono Csharp compiler service in this &lt;a href="http://naveensrinivasan.com/2010/05/11/using-c-compiler-as-a-service-in-f-poshconsole-powershell/">post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
