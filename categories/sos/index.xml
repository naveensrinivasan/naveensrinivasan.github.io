      <description>I recently noticed another blog post refer to one of my post. The issue was, sos wasn&amp;#8217;t enabling the break-points on non-jitted functions. The classic example being &amp;#8220;Main&amp;#8221;. Thanks to Steve  I have been using sosex and not sos for setting break-points.
From my previous post  you can understand how CLR is using clrn/CLRNotificationException to notify sos/sosex on JIT. With this information when I looked at the rotor code, I noticed an interesting member variable &amp;#8220;g_dacNotificationFlags&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>Sometimes when debugging managed code within the debugger I would like to see the C# code ,the IL translation for the managed code and the Assembly code for the IL. For example I recently learned that callvirt MSIL instruction must do the null-check before invoking method.

      <title>Script to !SaveAllModules in .NET 4.0 SOS within Windbg</title>

      <description>The .NET 4.0 sos doesn’t have save all modules (!SaveAllModules) command. It only has !SaveModule. Recently I was debugging a .NET 4.0 process for which I had to save all the modules. Here is a script that does !SaveAllModules.
[sourcecode]
!for_each_module .if ($spat (&amp;ldquo;${@#ImageName}&amp;rdquo;,&amp;rdquo;*.exe&amp;rdquo;)) { !SaveModule ${@#Base} c:temp${@#ModuleName}.exe } .else { !SaveModule ${@#Base} c:temp${@#ModuleName}.dll }

      <title>Dumping ASP.NET Session (x86 /x64) within Windbg</title>

      <description>This post is going to be about dumping ASP.NET session objects using Windbg. I had recently answered a stackoverflow question in which someone wanted to dump ASP.NET session objects for 64-bit IIS (x64). I thought why not blog about the same which might be useful to others. The challenge is to write one script that should work in both x86/x64. FYI there is a script from Tess that does dump out the session contents, AFAIK it will not work on x64 and my script iterates through the array using the array length instead of using “.</description>

      <title>Script to load sos within Windbg based on .NET Framework version</title>

      <description>I often debug .NET Framework v 2.0 / v 4.0 code within windbg. In v 2.0 the main clr dll was called &amp;#8220;mscorwks.dll&amp;#8221; and in v 4.0 it is called &amp;#8220;clr.dll&amp;#8221;. As many of you are aware , to load sos in v 2.0 we would have to enter &amp;#8220;.loadby sos mscorwks&amp;#8221; and in v 4.0 it would be &amp;#8220;.loadby sos clr&amp;#8221; . This was a pain for me. Came up with a script to automate loading sos based on clr version</description>

      <title>Debugging Generic System.Nullable within Windbg</title>

      <description>In this post I am going to unravel the mystery of debugging the Nullable within Windbg in .NET 3.5 and also compare it with .NET 4.0. Here is the sample code and it is compiled in .NET 3.5
[sourcecode language=&amp;#8221;csharp&amp;#8221;]
using System;
namespace ConsoleApplication
{
class Program
{
Int32? test;
int i = 10;
static void Main(string[] args)
{
Nullable
Int32? i = 10;
Object o = 10;
var p = new Program() { test = 20 };</description>
