&lt;p>I am using the adventofcode to improve my functional programming skills. The gist of the problem is to solve the logic gates which is represented as 16 bit integer’s  and these depend on other gates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The puzzle starts of with simple problem&lt;/p>

The one issue with that is it is based on mono 4.0.4 which is buggy and fsharp does not work very well. The latest alpha release of the mono with which fsharp works well is 4.2.0. The 4.2.0 isn’t available in stable channels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I created a docker image with the latest mono from their alpha repo and using the latest fsharp from the github.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using F# to Automate Reading–The Morning Brew</title><link>/?p=997/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2010 04:27:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>/?p=997/</guid><description>&lt;p>I guess most of the .NET Devs read &lt;a href="http://blog.cwa.me.uk/">The Morning Brew&lt;/a>, if not you should.  It is a morning newspaper for the dev, so I end up reading it first thing when I go to work. I like to  try and automate most of the stuff . So I thought why not write a script that reads the Morning Brew feed, filter the excluded content that I am not interested in and open the urls before I come in. The reason behind using F# is I don’t have to compile the code. I could use it with FSI.exe. Incase if the extraction logic changes and I don’t have to recompile , it is just fixing the script. The best part of writing in F# is I avoid all the ceremony. Here is the F# code, it is nothing fancy. And this code can easily be modified for other link collection sites.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resharper Template for F#</title><link>/?p=6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2010 19:06:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>/?p=6/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have been hacking F# lately and I am big fan of ReSharper. So why not create a few Live Templates for the things i do daily in F#.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/dvXmEH">Download&lt;/a> R# live template for F#. I am sure there are few more things that can be part of this template. I have posted the code in MSDN Code gallery so that others can find and contribute.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
