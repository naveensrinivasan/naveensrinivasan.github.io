I  have been using docker very often now and because I have been spending most of time in the terminal it made sense to use alias to reduce the typing.

[gist id = &#8220;d6b41d000b93f3ecc3e7a1b900c7382c&#8221;]

I have curated this from others and have also customized to what I want.

All my aliases are stored in my github repo <a href="https://github.com/naveensrinivasan/dotvim/blob/master/zshrc" target="_blank">https://github.com/naveensrinivasan/dotvim/blob/master/zshrc</a>
