I am honored to – once again – be a recipient of this award Google hands out to open source contributors annually. Getting this token of appreciation feels incredible. Thank you, Google! I have been a recipient of this award before, in 2021.

The award is a small token of appreciation from Google to open-source contributors. It is a way for Google to say “thank you” for the time and effort you have put into the open source community.
