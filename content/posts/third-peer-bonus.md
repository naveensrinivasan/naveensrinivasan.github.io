I am deeply honored to once again receive the Google Peer Bonus award for my contributions to the open-source community in 2024. This recognition feels incredibly rewarding. Thank you, Google!

I have been fortunate to receive this award in the past, in both 2021 and 2022. The Google Peer Bonus is a small yet significant token of appreciation from Google to open-source contributors. It serves as a “thank you” for the time and effort invested in the open-source community.

This year, my work on the [https://github.com/guacsec/guac](https://github.com/guacsec/guac) project has been particularly rewarding. Being part of such an impactful initiative makes this recognition even more special.
