Like most of the Dev&#8217;s I love using my Keyboard more than mouse. I am big vim fan and have been using vim for over 7-8 years. I still consider myself novice.

Here are the ways I manage to use keyboard over mouse

  * <a href="https://shortcatapp.com/" target="_blank">Shortcat</a> &#8211; Great app get rids of use mouse in OSX &#8211; This is a Paid App , which IMHO is the best investment for me. There is also a trial version.
  * MacVim &#8211; I have been using MacVim as my primary text editor.
  * <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cvim/ihlenndgcmojhcghmfjfneahoeklbjjh?hl=en" target="_blank">cVim</a> &#8211; Vim features within chrome. The best part is it allows custom vimrc.
  * IntelliJ Vim Plugin &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim" target="_blank">https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim</a> also allow vimrc
  * Here is a plugin <a href="https://github.com/athiele/key-promoter-fork" target="_blank">https://github.com/athiele/key-promoter-fork</a> for IntelliJ &#8211; show hints when using the mouse for something which could be done with the keyboard.
  * <a href="https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle" target="_blank">Spectacle</a> &#8211; For window management in OSX with keyboard.

Here is my vimrc  <a href="https://github.com/naveensrinivasan/dotvim/blob/master/vimrc" target="_blank">https://github.com/naveensrinivasan/dotvim/blob/master/vimrc</a>. One of the things I do  is , set no-op for arrow keys makes me a better vim user.  I have tried vim hard mode <a href="https://github.com/wikitopian/hardmode" target="_blank">https://github.com/wikitopian/hardmode</a> and have failed few times. That is something I want to enable to get rid of bad habits.

Still have to try <a href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank">Neovim</a>. I especially like the neovim engine can be plugged into existing editor which is great.

And  I have ordered myself <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/" target="_blank">Ultimate hacking Keyboard</a> . The one of the reasons I am excited about this is ,you could use home row keys as mouse which would really replace mouse with this keyboard.
