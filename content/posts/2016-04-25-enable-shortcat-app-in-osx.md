<a href="https://shortcatapp.com/" target="_blank">Shortcat</a> app is a software that I use everyday to keep me productive and reduce my dependency on mouse.

But if you have OSX El Captain you get a message to enable the assistive devices,. But it has been changed from the previous versions of OSX.

To enable the assistive devices navigate to  **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility** and enable for shortcat app.
