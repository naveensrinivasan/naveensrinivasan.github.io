I have been standing at work for the past 2  years. And I have seen significant improvement with respect to my productivity and non-drowsiness with standing desk. The one draw back with that I have seen was standing in a position where I put a lot of stress on one of the legs. And I wanted ti try something different.

That&#8217;s when I saw <a href="http://www.fluidstance.com" target="_blank">fluidstance</a>. Bought myself one which brings in a new challenge. I have been using it for a week and it is great  has made me sore in the places which I didn&#8217;t when I was standing without it.
