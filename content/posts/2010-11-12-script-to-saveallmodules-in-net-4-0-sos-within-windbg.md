The .NET 4.0 sos doesnâ€™t have save all modules (!SaveAllModules) command. It only has !SaveModule. Recently I was debugging a .NET 4.0 process for which I had to save all the modules. Here is a script that does !SaveAllModules.

[sourcecode]

!for\_each\_module .if ($spat ("${@#ImageName}","*.exe")) { !SaveModule ${@#Base} c:temp${@#ModuleName}.exe } .else { !SaveModule ${@#Base} c:temp${@#ModuleName}.dll }

[/sourcecode]
