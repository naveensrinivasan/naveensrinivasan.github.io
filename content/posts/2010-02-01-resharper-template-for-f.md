I have been hacking F# lately and I am big fan of ReSharper. So why not create a few Live Templates for the things i do daily in F#.

[Download][1] R# live template for F#. I am sure there are few more things that can be part of this template. I have posted the code in MSDN Code gallery so that others can find and contribute.
