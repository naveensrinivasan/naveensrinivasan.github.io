<img src=https://i.imgur.com/v9Ihe8x.png></p><p><em>TLDR</em>: I have consistently contributed to open source projects on GitHub for the past two years, making 4,155 contributions in the past year alone. As a result of my dedication, I have become a member of several organizations and received a Google Peer Bonus award. I have also had the opportunity to speak at Linux Foundation conferences about supply chain security. My contributions to the open source community and supply chain security have been rewarding and fulfilling, and I look forward to continuing my work in this field.</p><hr><p>As an OSS contributor who is passionate about open source software and supply chain security, I am thrilled to share that I have made <a href="https://github.com/naveensrinivasan?tab=overview&from=2022-12-01&to=2022-12-24">4,155 contributions on GitHub</a> in the past year. I am proud to say that I have not missed a single day of contribution in the past 2 years, starting on December 30, 2020.</p><p>My dedication to open source development has allowed me to make valuable contributions to the community and opened up new opportunities for me. Through my contributions to supply chain security projects with the <a href=https://github.com/ossf>OpenSSF</a> organization, I became a member of the <a href=https://github.com/sigstore/>Sigstore</a> and <a href=https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator>SLSA-GitHub-Generator</a> organizations.</p><p>Becoming a member of these organizations was a challenging task and required significant hard work and dedication. To be considered for membership, I had to consistently contribute high-quality code and actively participate in the development process. I also had to demonstrate a strong understanding of the project goals and vision and be willing to collaborate with other team members.</p><p>But the effort was worth it, as being a member of these organizations has given me access to valuable resources and opportunities for learning and growth. I have worked with talented OSS contributors worldwide, shared my knowledge and experience with others, and made a meaningful impact on the open source community.</p><p>In addition to my contributions to these organizations, I was also recognized for my efforts with a <a href=https://naveensrinivasan.com/posts/2022-09-06-google-peer-bonus/>Google Peer Bonus award in 2022 second year in a row</a>. This award is given to exceptional contributors who have contributed significantly to open source projects, and I am honored to have received it.</p><p>I have also had the privilege of speaking at <a href=https://events.linuxfoundation.org/>Linux Foundation conferences</a> about supply chain security and sharing my knowledge and experience with others in the industry. These conferences have allowed me to engage in meaningful discussions about the future of open source software and learn about new developments in the field.</p><p>Overall, my contributions to open source development and supply chain security have been a rewarding and fulfilling experience. I am grateful for the opportunities I have had to positively impact the community and improve the security and reliability of supply chains. I look forward to continuing my work in this field and contributing even more.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>
